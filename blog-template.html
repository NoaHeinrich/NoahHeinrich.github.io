<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  Wireframing with a partner was strange, because it's much more of a subjective practice. Unlike coding, wireframing is very much in the eye of the beholder. We decided to wireframe seperately, and compare our designs, and then use the normal driver/navigator mode for the html. -->
<!-- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I did find it to be helpful. By making a wireframe, I was able to plan out my html much more easily, because I had an image in my head that I was working towards. While using html or other code, it's sometimes easy to forget how your page will actually look, since all you can see is code. -->
<!-- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We both agreed that a wireframe should stress usability. My pair had many good suggestions about adding ways to more easily navigate around the site, rather than making the blog page a dead end. We also agreed that it should look clean and uncluttered. -->
<!-- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  I did not learn any new semantic elements during this challenge. We decided to use more of the non-semantic elements that we were already familiar with. -->
