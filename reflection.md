  <li>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</li>
    I learned that these concepts are a lot more difficult to work with in practice than they are in theory. Margin in particular is affected by the position element, and where it is relative to other elements on the page. The secret to positioning, at least for me, is to check your page often, to make sure it's doing what you think it's going to do.
  <li>What did you learn about CSS positioning?</li>
  I learned that you can't count on things to do what you think they will, at least not now. Always check to see if an element's position is fixed, absolute, etc., and be sure to understand what those mean. It also helps to have a good mental picture of the distance units you plan on using, like px or em.
  <li>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</li>
  The easiest aspects of the design to implement were colors, borders, and fonts. These, more often than not, don't impact other elements within the page. On the other hand, positioning is extremely tricky, and even relatively simple things, such as width:100%, need to be hacked a little to work right.
  <li>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</li>
  I learned that Chrome Devtools are extremely helpful for this, since you can see what you're changing in real time, instead of opening the file in a browser over and over. I also learned that you need to pay close attention to what each element is doing and where it is, otherwise they will behave in ways that you don't expect.
