     I didn't know it, but I've been doing version control for years. As a writer, I attempt to explore multiple storylines and possibilities for every story I create. My computer, therefore, is cluttered with alternate versions of the same chapter, and variations of the same fictional world, over and over. These take up a lot of space on my hard drive, but I don't dare part with a single one.  The reason I hold onto them, of course, is that any one of them could be useful for a future book or short story.

      This process applies to coding as well. Version control lets you easily explore and differentiate possibilities of your code. Instead of saving multiple versions in separate files, however, these alternate codes are arranged like branches on a tree. The trunk of your tree, the Master, is the final code that you will eventually send out into the world. The branches are alternate versions of the code, which you can edit and test to your heart's content before merging into the Master. Version control is important, therefore, since it lets you and others keep track of what you change, and consider it carefully before finalizing it.

        A useful tool for version control is git, a coding directory that focuses on it. Git helps me with version control because it is fairly simple to use. Creating and switching between branches is easy, and it encourages you to examine your code carefully before passing it along to gitHub.com.
  GitHub is what really makes git special. With a few simple commands, you can pass your code along to an online repository, which you can share with other people. The benefit of this is collaboration: you can share a project with multiple people. When you send a branch to gitHub, anybody you're working with can review it before allowing you to merge it with the master code.
  The secret to coding, like any profession, is good communication. Using git and gitHub for your version control is an extremely expedient way of communicating with your teammates. Admittedly, I don't know of any alternatives to git, but I can nevertheless recommend it.
