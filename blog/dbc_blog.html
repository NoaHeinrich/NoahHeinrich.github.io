        <h3>Click Lit: Writers Who Code</h3>
        <p>5/16/16</p>
        <p>English Majors of the world, you should learn to code.</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, I too was an English major at a small, liberal arts college. Although I would have been perfectly content to hide in a small fortress made of post-modern readings of 19th century feminist literature, I still had to meet a Mathematics distribution requirement. This led to taking my school's Intro to Computer Programming course, which consisted of a series of algorithm problems done in C++. I barely passed the course, and my GPA never entirely recovered.</p>
        <p>So how does somebody like me transition from the liberal arts to professional web development? Moreover, why would I do that? I mean, aside from the massive increase in average salary?</p>
        <p>Simply put, my life was in a bit of a rut. After earning my Bachelor's, and finishing two years of AmeriCorps, I was working part-time as an ACT teacher, while doing my best to write the next Lord of the Rings. Hell, I would have settled for writing the next Chronicles of Prydain.</p>
        <p>Don't get me wrong, I love teaching, but there's no challenge in running through the same 6-week curriculum over and over. I wasn't growing or learning anything new, and I felt generally unsatisfied with the direction I was moving, or not moving, in. 25 years old is too young to hit a midlife crisis, yet there I was.</p>
        <p>It was then that a friend of mine suggested Dev Bootcamp, a 19-week-long intensive coding bootcamp. My first concern, of course, was that I was an English major; I had a general chauvinism towards all things mathematic to uphold. Besides, I had nearly flunked C++. Nevertheless, my friend insisted that Dev Bootcamp took a lot of literary people, and suggested I try a few online coding courses to see how I felt. So I booted up Code Academy's Ruby course, and tried it out. Turns out, coding isn't all bubble sorts and binary search trees. In fact, if you're a writer, coding might actually be a good fit for you.</p>
        <p>Coding languages are just languages, at the end of the day, ones that are much simpler to understand than most. Every coding language has its own syntax, grammar, and contradictory quirks. A program is simply a list of instructions you write to the very literal-minded friend who lives in your laptop. Yes, math is involved, but the most complicated formulae have already been solved by people much smarter than you.</p>
        <p>You may ask, Hypothetic English Major, “why should I take up coding? Shouldn't I remain true to my craft?” Good question, by the way. I have three reasons why you might enjoy learning to code, even if you don't adopt it as a profession.</p>
        <p>One, coding flexes a lot of the same muscles as creative or expository writing. A good story, poem, or essay relies on consistency, logic, attention to detail, good proofreading, proper use of grammar, and, most importantly, the ability to envision a physical product out of language. Programming—particularly in object-oriented languages like Ruby and Python—uses the same skills. A program is just an essay that eventually returns some kind of value.</p>
        <p>Two, coding broadens your horizons. As a writer, you've probably explored dozens of platforms to share your work, whether you use Wordpress, Tumblr, Facebook, or are even one of those holdouts on LiveJournal. With an even a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, however, you can craft your own website from scratch. Not only is this just cool, it also lends you an air of professionalism and respectability that your Tumblr account just doesn't give you. Even if you've never published a story in your life, you can make an author site that you can be proud of. It also lets you experiment with new forms of interactive media. Want to make your own choose your own adventure game? Done.</p>
        <p>Three, it makes you a part of an amazing community. In my experience, coders are some of the nicest, most welcoming people I know. True, there are some jerks, but there always are, no matter where you go. If you attend one of the hundreds of meetups that are out there, you will meet people who are passionate about their craft, and are always willing to teach you something cool. In one gathering, I received a lesson in Clojure and the significance of bread in Hungarian culture at the same time. You really never know what sort of wonderful, eclectic people you'll meet.</p>
        <p>If there's one thing I've learned on this journey, it's that you don't need to place yourself into a box. You don't have to be a Writer, and subsist solely on ink and old copies of The Waste Land. You don't have to be a Programmer, and transfer your consciousness into a console. There is room enough within you for these identities, and so much more.</p>
