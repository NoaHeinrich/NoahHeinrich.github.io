        <h3>Designing for Accessibility</h3>
        <p>6/8/16</p>
        <p>My current personal project is designed to improve accessibility for visually impaired users. In essence, it's a platform for users to add audio descriptions to youtube videos, so that people who have trouble seeing them have a way of knowing what is happening beyond the audio. YouDescribe.org does exactly this, but I wanted to try making it on my own. They say there's no new ideas under the sun, after all.</p>

        <p>One thing I realized though, is that even if I was making an accessibility tool, I didn't know much about making my own website accessible. So for future reference, I've assembled a quick list of general guidelines if you want to make your site accessible as well. For more details, you'll want to visit the American Foundation for the Blind's website.</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, a user who is completely blind uses the web with a screen reader, which is compatible with most major browsers. A screen reader goes through a page, and reads off the contents through a voice synthesizer. To make your website more screen reader friendly, the most important thing to do is label everything. Images, sections of your page, forms, and links, if it could use an alternate description, give it one. Make the description short and explicit. “Photo of the author at a rock concert” is better than “me getting shwasted at the Talking Heads revival tour in Austin”, for example. Make sure that sections of the page have explicit headings, so that the user will know what to expect through each part of your page. Each link should also have a descriptive name.</p>

        <p>Not all visually impaired users need a screen reader, however. Many people use screen magnifying programs, or simply adjust their monitors to improve visibility. The best way to make your website accommodating to people with these needs may not be very popular with some. I know y'all love your soft pastel color palettes, but low contrast themes like that can make your page more difficult to read. If you want your page to be readable to everybody, make your text high contrast, with your light text on a dark background, such as white or light yellow on black. When picking fonts, use non-decorative fonts. Arial is a solid choice, but most sans-serif fonts will do. Avoid using all caps, and make the text big and bold when possible.</p>

      <p>Now, you may ask yourself designing for accessibility matters. I would go off about why, but honestly, I think this should be self-evident. We design buildings with wheelchair ramps and handicapped parking spaces because it's a very small price to pay to help people who need it. In fact, making a building handicap accessible is a net gain for you, since now a large segment of the population—about 19% in America—can enter your building and buy your stuff. Making your website accessible to the visually impaired should be a no-brainer. More accessibility means more traffic for you, and all it costs you is the time it takes to fiddle with the CSS.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, don't be a jerk. Follow these simple tips, and you can make your website, and the internet, a slightly less awful place.</p>
