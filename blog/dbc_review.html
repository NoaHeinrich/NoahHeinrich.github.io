        <h3>Bootcamp Memories: A Review</h3>
        <p>5/23/16</p>
        <p>Technology, we have all been told, is the next big thing. The fastest growing companies in America are all trading in web-based products, and experienced developers may very well find themselves earning six figures in just a few years. It's like the California gold rush, but instead of a rusty pan, a coon-skin cap, and a case of syphilis, all you need is a laptop and a GitHub account. Vigorous jigging is entirely optional!</p>

        <p>(Pictured above: rookie .NET developer)</p>
        <p>To take advantage of this boom, a number of coding “bootcamps” have arisen, with the express purpose of changing a person with zero programming experience into a workforce-ready junior developer. If it sounds too good to be true, I don't blame you. More and more bootcamps are popping up every day, and there is no real system of accreditation or regulation in place. Not all of them are going to be as effective as they claim.</p>
        <p>Last year, I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp here in Chicago. Dev Bootcamp, or DBC, is one of the first in its field, and, I am told, among the most respected. Before that, I was a teacher and a freelance creative writer. It's been almost six months now since I've graduated, so it seems high time to reflect on my experiences there. If you are considering trying out DBC, or another program like General Assembly, this may prove useful to you.</p>
        <p>Dev Bootcamp is a 19-week long program, consisting of 4 phases: an introductory phase that is done from home, and then three phases of in-person classes that last all day, every day. During this time you will learn Ruby, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Sinatra, Ruby on Rails, JQuery, and BackboneJS. It is not an easy ride, to be sure. Nine or ten-hour days are common, and I found myself working through the weekends too, more often than not. If you enroll in Dev Bootcamp, you do not have time for another job, so make sure you have some way of keeping yourself fed for nine-weeks, after paying the hefty price tag.</p>
        <p>The main question you probably want answered is, “will this make me a good coder?” The answer to that is “probably.” Like any school, you will get as much out of DBC as you put into it. Even so, nine weeks is not a long time to learn how to code. I left knowing how to program a decent web app, but I quickly realized that during my time at DBC we barely scratched the surface of web development.</p>
        <p>This is actually an advantage, if you ask me, because DBC's real payoff is not in hard skills, but soft skills. The instructors at Dev Bootcamp are all veterans in the industry, and they know what kind of people do well in the workplace; curious, motivated individuals who know how to get along well with others, while at the same time are capable of taking the reins of their own education. There is a good amount of direct instruction, but most of the hard work you have to do yourself or with a partner. When people asked me the most useful thing I learned at Dev Bootcamp, it's how to learn.</p>
        <p>The part I liked most, however, was that DBC students are not expected to be machines. Yes, it is a bootcamp, and yes you are expected to put in the hours; however, there is also a great deal of emphasis on self-care, and learning how to pace yourself. There were times when I was on the verge of burning myself out, but found that I was in the company of people who cared about me, and supported me without holding my hand every step of the way.</p>
        <p>There are downsides, of course. The very format of a bootcamp means that there will be a lot of stuff that you probably wont understand afterwards. DBC produces coders, not engineers, and it will be years before I understand the internet works as well as your average CS graduate does.</p>
        <p>This brings us to the real reason you're here: will Dev Bootcamp get you a job? As of now, I haven't, but the majority of my classmates are now well-established in their first roles around the country. The last week of DBC is dedicated to career-training, where they give you a crash course in reaching out to companies and selling yourself as the kind of junior developer they want to hire. It isn't as easy as they make it sound, of course. As I've learned over the past few months, there seems to be a stigma among some tech companies, concerning junior developers coming out of coding bootcamps. Some of the best organizations in Chicago post job listings explicitly saying that applicants without at least a Bachelor's in computer science will be rejected out of hand. I may be biased, but I find that to be a bit narrow-minded.</p>
        <p>So, why should you enroll in a coding bootcamp? You should definitely sign up if you're passionate about the craft of coding for it's own sake. If you're seeking a change in your life, and want to be challenged on a daily basis, DBC will also be a good fit for you. If all you care about is getting the $65K desk job, I do not recommend this program. If you aren't fascinated by programming, then you will get tired very quickly, and wont stand out to most companies anyway. </p>
        <p>All in all, I am very glad I did Dev Bootcamp. If you had asked me a year ago if I would ever become a web developer, I would never have believed that a twenty-something English major could make such a drastic turn in his life. Yet here I am, writing to you in a blog that I made by hand, while working on a web application of my own design. Your life isn't hardcoded—take some chances.</p>
