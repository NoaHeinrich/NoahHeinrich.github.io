      It seems like it's impossible to talk about making any field more accessible without hearing some voice in the distance shouting “What is this SJW bull?” Those who shout that are, often, the kind of people who park in handicapped parking spots, rationalizing that their own lives are just as hard as that of a disabled person. In reality, I think it's the duty of an ethical society to be considerate of all people, and that includes the tech industry. Although it's hard to make a website perfectly accessible to literally everybody, it doesn't hurt anybody to make your site as open as possible to those with common disabilities. Since I only have an hour for this, I'm going to focus on design principles friendly to those with ADHD.

      ADHD is one of the most common learning disabilities in the United States right now. Those affected have trouble focusing on a single topic, and are easily distracted. As you can imagine, navigating the internet with this condition can be a difficult experience, particularly if you are out to research a paper or accomplish some other task. A lot of websites are designed to be eyecatching. They want to draw your attention to all of the NEAT THINGS you HAVE TO SEE right NOW! This is doubly true when a website hosts banner ads and pop-ups.

    Unfortunately, it isn't financially feasible to run a site without ads, and if you plan on running a clickbait site, then I don't know what to say. However, there are a few simple steps you can take to make your site ADHD friendly. First off is color selection. Think of the most popular social media sites out there. Notice how most of them incorporate a lot of blue into the design? Blue is an easy to read color, and is also scientifically shown to have a calming effect on the human mind. Blue on an off-white background is a very common choice because it is both aesthetically pleasing, and friendly to neurodivergent users. Stay away from red and yellow, since they're very distracting (I'm looking at you, Buzzfeed).

    Furthermore, keep away from brightly flashing logos and graphics. These can be horribly distracting to people with ADHD, and potentially deadly to a person with epilepsy. Also, they're just really tacky. Another useful feature to consider is adding a warning when a link would navigate the user away from the site. Finally, if you have a website that has pop-up dialogue boxes, look into plug-ins that can darken or fade the background while the dialogue box is up.

    These are just a few ways to make your website more accessible. Granted, this article is coming from the perspective of a person without ADHD, so if you have feedback for me about how to better format a website, I'd really appreciate it!
