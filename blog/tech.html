      There's an old joke that goes like this. If you want to understand recursion, read this sentence again. Recursion can be a bit of an intimidating topic, because it seems like a less controlled version of looping. Looping, as you know, can be dangerous, because if the break condition isn't met, the loop will run forever. Recursion is a loop too, but doesn't come with easy to explain methods like while or for. A recursive program calls on itself to continue the program, and will do so as many times as it takes to accomplish the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explaining a recursive program in plain english is an exercise in confusion, but I'll try it anyway. The classic example of using recursion is calculating factorial. (Quick explanation, a number factorial is that number multiplied by every whole number between that number and 1. So 5 factorial is 5*4*3*2*1).
    </p>
    <p>
     We have our method, called factorial, that accepts an integer. First, we have a case statement that states that if the integer is 0, the program returns 1. In the alternate case, we multiply the integer by factorial, calling on the method minus 1. And so the program would call on the method, and check if the new number is 0, and if not it will multiply the new number, times factorial on the next smallest number. And so on and so on, until you reach 0. Make sense? If you're like me, it's hard to envision. Here's what that whole song and dance looks like in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <pre>
    var factorial = function(n) {
      if (n===0) {
        return 1;
      }
      else {
        var x = n;
        x = x*factorial(x-1);
        return x;
      }
    };
    </pre>
    <p>
      That's revision in a nutshell. A function that calls on itself, thus forming a loop. You may ask, why use a recursive function at all? The fact of the matter is that there is no hard and fast rule as to when and where to use a recursive function. In the case of our factorial function, we could have gotten the same effect by using a for loop. However, doing so would have required defining at least one more variable, and would not have been quite as DRY. Recursive functions are powerful tools that are best used on a case-by-case basis. The main things to ask yourself are: can this function be simplified if it calls on itself? And do I have a sound break condition? If both of these questions are met, feel free to recurse yourself into infinity.
