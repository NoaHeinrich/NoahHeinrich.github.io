          Noah Heinrich was born on June 6, 1990, in Oak Park, IL. He grew up in Detroit, where he first took a very basic website design class, using Microsoft FrontPage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He attended Kenyon College, where he took one semester of C++ (which he nearly flunked out of.) He graduated in 2012, with a bachelor's degree in English with honors. Afterwards, being an English major, he struggled to find a paying job, but eventually went to work as a volunteer for City Year.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a City Year corps member, he saw how badly the school system is failing students in inner city Detroit. He also noticed that many people were attempting to utilize information technology in the classroom. None of it really worked. (I mean come on, who do you know that actually uses a smartboard?)
        </p>
        <p>
          Noah continued in a career in education, while pursuing writing on the side. In April of 2015 he had his first short story published. Eventually, he learned of Dev Bootcamp, and thought of all the awful websites and apps schools try to use to help their students.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can do better than that!" he thought to himself, and eagerly signed up. He is currently attending Dev Bootcamp, and hopes to eventually work in education or non-profit as a web developer.
