            <p>I am a web developer, who enjoys using his skills and knowledge in service of a greater purpose. Whether I am writing code, prose, or lesson plans, I take immense satisfaction in overcoming obstacles in order to assemble a high quality product. I am accustomed to changing conditions, and feel most alive outside of my comfort zone.</p>

            <p>In October, 2015, I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp, because I felt that my life and career needed a new direction. Until then, my only experience in programming had been one semester of C++. Now, I am proficient with Ruby, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3. Additionally, I have become a more empathic team member, and have grown as both a leader and a full-stack developer.</p>

            <p>My purpose in life has always been helping others, and I hope to do so in my new career. As a corps member, and then a team leader with City Year Detroit, I was able to exercise my communication skills in service to furthering the education of at-risk youth. It was during this time that I first noticed how under-utilized technology is in the classroom. I knew then that one key to closing the country's education gap is making sure that web and mobile technology is not limited to schools in wealthy districts.</p>

            <p>Whether in Detroit or Chicago, I take pride in my community, and the challenges it overcomes every day. Being able to pursue my newfound craft while raising my city up would make me happier than I can easily put into words.</p>
