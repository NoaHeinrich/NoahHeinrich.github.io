    The Ruby Enumerable Method Cheat Sheet
  </header>
  <article>
    <p id="intro">
    The following is the definition of Enumerable, according to <a href="http://ruby-doc.org">ruby-doc.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p id="def">
      The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method #each, which yields successive members of the collection. If Enumerable #max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on an ordering between members of the collection. Included in arrays and hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In layman's terms, Enumerable is any class that has a built-in method for iterating over every element contained within it, using the .each method. Both arrays and hashes are fully compatible with Enumerable's built-in methods. Included below are explanations of some of the methods that I have personally found to be the most useful. The full list can be found <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html">here</a>.

    <ul>
      <li>
        #count is a method that returns the number of elements in the collection. If you pass it an argument, it will return the count of how many elements are equal to the argument.
      </li>
      <pre>
        collection=["Skeletor, He-Man, She-Ra, Skeletor"]
        collection.count #=> 4
        collection.count("Skeletor") #=> 2
      </pre>
      <li>
        #cycle will iterate over the collection and run a block of code on it. Without any argument, cycle will keep doing this forever. You can pass it an argument that will tell it how many times to run the code block instead.
      </li>
      <pre>
        catchphrase=["Curse", "You", "He-Man!"]
        catchphrase.cycle(2) { |x| print x }
        # Curse You He-Man!Curse You He-Man!
      </pre>
      <li>
        #find_all will return an array of all numbers in a collection that return true for a given condition. #find_index is similar, but instead returns the index number of the first item to match the criteria.
      </li>
      <pre>
        (1..100).find_all { |x| x%10==0 }
        #=> [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
        (1..100).find_index { |x| x%10==0 }
        #=> 9
      </pre>
      <li>
        #include? returns true if the collection contains the given object.
      </li>
      <pre>
        collection=["Skeletor, He-Man, She-Ra, Skeletor"]
        collection.include?("Optimus Prime")
        #=> false
      </pre>
      <li>
        #map is a very useful method. In essence, it's a shortened each-do statement, that will do to every element in the collection whatever you tell it to.
      </li>
      <pre>
        (1..10).map { |x| x*2 }
        #=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
      </pre>
      <li>
        #max and #max_by return the largest element contained in the collection. max_by is most useful when working with a collection of strings, since you might want the largest element by length, for example. #min and #min_by do the same thing, but for the smallest element.
      </li>
      <pre>
        (1..10).max
        (1..10).min
        #=> 10
        #=> 1
      </pre>
      <li>
        #reduce is a very handy method that will take every integer in an array, and combine them together, either by addition or multiplication, or even subtraction or division. Remember that in order to use the operator you want, you need to include a colon.
      </li>
      <pre>
        (1..5).reduce(:+)
        #=> 15
        (1..5).reduce(:*)
        #=> 120
      </pre>
      <li>
        #sort will automatically sort an array either from least to greatest number, or alphabetically. If you want to reverse the order, you can pass it an argument to tell it so.
      </li>
      <pre>
        (1..5).sort{ |x, y| y<=>x }
        #=> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
      </pre>
      <li>
        More to come!
      </li>
